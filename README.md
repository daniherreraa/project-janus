# 🛰️ Project JANUS  
### The Space Biology Knowledge Engine  
**NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**

---

## 🌌 Overview

**Project JANUS** is an interactive web-based platform that transforms NASA’s open space biology datasets into a unified, explorable knowledge engine.  
It enables scientists, students, and mission planners to visualize how microgravity, radiation, and other space conditions impact living systems — from **cellular behavior** to **human health risks**.

JANUS bridges the gap between complex raw data and meaningful biological insights, offering an intuitive way to move **“From Data to Decisions.”**

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- 📊 **Integrates** open data from NASA’s Space Biology archives.  
- 🧬 **Categorizes** studies into key biological areas: Human Risks, Plants & Microbes, and Research & Missions.  
- 🌍 **Visualizes** experiments through dynamic GSAP-powered interfaces and animated data graphs.  
- 🔍 **Enables exploration** via semantic search and connected cards for each experiment.  
- 💡 **Supports discovery** by revealing hidden patterns and relationships across missions.

## 🧠 How It Works

JANUS collects structured data from NASA’s open archives, organizes it into thematic categories, and presents it through a visually rich, interactive interface.  
The platform allows users to:
1. Search by **organism**, **mission**, or **condition**.  
2. Explore related experiments via animated transitions.  
3. Understand biological adaptation through real-time visual storytelling.

## 🧬 Impact

By making space biology data accessible and interactive, JANUS helps the scientific community:
- Accelerate discoveries about life in space.  
- Improve planning of future biological experiments in orbit.  
- Inspire educational use of NASA’s datasets worldwide.
